Counter App

This is a simple counter application built using HTML, TailWindCSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value.

Features:
- Increment the counter value by one.
- Decrement the counter value by one.
- Reset the counter value to zero.
- Display the current counter value on the screen.

The application provides a user-friendly interface with intuitive buttons for performing the counter operations. It also updates the counter value dynamically as the user interacts with the app.

This project is a great starting point for learning and practicing basic JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation. It can be extended and customized to fit different requirements, such as adding additional functionalities or styling.
